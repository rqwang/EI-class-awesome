    "# Styling your plots\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever exposing your work to an external audience (like, say, the Kaggle userbase), styling your work is a must. The defaults in `pandas` (and other tools) are rarely exactly right for the message you want to communicate. Tweaking your plot can greatly enhance the communicative power of your visualizations, helping to make your work more impactful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we'll learn how to style the visualizations we've been creating. Because there are *so many* things you can tweak in your plot, it's impossible to cover everything, so we won't try to be comprehensive here. Instead this section will cover some of the most useful basics: changing figure sizes, colors, and font sizes; adding titles; and removing axis borders.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important skill in plot styling is knowing how to look things up. Comments like \"I have been using Matplotlib for a decade now, and I still have to look most things up\" are [all too common](https://youtu.be/aRxahWy-ul8?t=2m42s). If you're styling a `seaborn` plot, the library's [gallery](http://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/) and [API documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html) are a great place to find styling options. And for both `seaborn` and `pandas` there is a wealth of information that you can find by looking up \"how to do X with Y\" on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (replacing X with what you want to do, and Y with `pandas` or `seaborn`). If you want to change your plot in some way not covered in this brief tutorial, and don't already know what function you need to do it, searching like this is the most efficient way of finding it."

    "\n",
    "Oftentimes as a part of the exploratory data visualization process you will find yourself creating a large number of smaller charts probing one or a few specific aspects of the data. For example, suppose we're interested in comparing the scores for relatively common wines with those for relatively rare ones. In these cases, it makes logical sense to combine the two plots we would produce into one visual \"unit\" for analysis and discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we combine subplots with the style attributes we explored in the previous notebook, this technique allows us to create extremely attractive and informative panel displays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, subplots are critically useful because they enable **faceting**. Faceting is the act of breaking data variables up across multiple subplots, and combining those subplots into a single figure. So instead of one bar chart, we might have, say, four, arranged together in a grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended way to perform faceting is to use the `seaborn` `FacetGrid` facility. This feature is explored in a separate section of this tutorial.\n",

    "\n",
    "And faceting is easy because transitioning from plotting a `kdeplot` to gridding them out, as here, is very simple. It doesn't require learning any new visualization techniques. The limitations are the same ones that held for the plots you use inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Faceting does have some important limitations however. It can only be used to break data out across singular or paired categorical variables with very low numeracy&mdash;any more than five or so dimensions in the grid, and the plots become too small (or involve a lot of scrolling). Additionally it involves choosing (or letting Python) an order to plot in, but with nominal categorical variables that choice is distractingly arbitrary.\n",
